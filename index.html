                            <li><p><strong>Insight Visualization: Key Indicators of World Happiness</strong>
                                I created charts and graphs to illustrate the impact of 
                                GDP, social support, life expectancy, and other factors on happiness scores, 
                                showing clear correlations and trends.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Year-after-year Trend Analysis</strong>
                                I designed visuals to display happiness score changes over time, 
                                highlighting regions with significant changes and 
                                enabling easy comparison between countries and years.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>User-centric Data Storytelling</strong>
                                Structured the dashboard to guide users through the data, 
                                emphasizing the most impactful insights and trends. 
                                Each element is organized to create a cohesive narrative of 
                                how happiness levels vary globally and over time.
                                Finally, I included filters and custom tooltips that
                                allow users to explore specific countries or regions, 
                                providing a personalized data exploration experience.</p></li>
