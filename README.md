Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website

Project Description: This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional profile. The website provides a structured, visually appealing way to present my background, expertise, and project work. The styling emphasizes a clean, cohesive design that highlights my abilities in front-end web development.

Below I list the summary of my works in this project:

1. Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring the website looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.
2. Custom Styling with CSS: A carefully selected color scheme, custom fonts, and a consistent visual theme are applied across all sections. The jumbotron header, navigation bar, and footer sections are styled for visual impact and ease of navigation.
3. Organized Content Structure: The website includes sections for an "About Me" introduction, a "Projects" showcase, and links to my external profiles on GitHub and Tableau. Each project is neatly organized with descriptions and images to illustrate my work.
4. Interactive Navigation:The navigation menu is fixed at the top and provides quick access to each section of the website, enhancing usability. Hover effects on links add a layer of interactivity for a polished, professional feel. Project Highlights Section:
5. The "Projects" section displays summaries of my key projects, each with an image gallery, descriptions, and a bulleted list of accomplishments, giving visitors a clear overview of my work and skills.
This portfolio website demonstrates my proficiency in HTML and CSS, showing how thoughtful design and styling choices can create a professional and engaging online presence.
It serves as a central hub for my work and showcases my dedication to quality and detail in web development.
